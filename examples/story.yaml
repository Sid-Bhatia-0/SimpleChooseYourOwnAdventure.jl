      You have an appointment for a car driving test today at TOTPADLATAT (The Organization That Provides A Driving License After Taking A Test).

      Your friends have been helping you practice for some time now, always being by your side (quite literally, in the passenger seat).

      You reach the test location along with a friend, fully prepared to crush it this time, unlike some of your previous attempts... 

      You ask your friend to go back, assuring that you will get a license this time and drive the car back on your own, like a champion. Your friend has faith in you.

      You still feel a little nervous though.

      You walk into the office and wait in the first line you see.

      There you stand.

      Alone.

      With strangers around you.

      Your turn comes soon.

      Your nervousness creeps up again as your turn approaches.

      But this time, you won't let it interfere.

      It is finally your turn to move to the front of the line.

      As you are thinking about pushing away the nervousness, your feet accidentally push the accelerator a little too hard.

      You almost bump the car into the instructor as he moves towards you.

      As you move towards the curb, the front side of your car hits the curb pretty hard.

      The car stops with a jerk.

      But you are determined.

      So you turn your wheel and keep going.

      This produces a screeching sound.

      Not a good sign.

      Nevertheless, you somehow manage to park the vehicle.

      It isn't parallel to the curb.

      But that is not the most pressing concern anymore.

      The instructor stays calm.

      Unsurprisingly perhaps.

      Because it is not his vehicle.

      And in a matter of factly tone, says..."You know you messed it up, right?"

      He then asks you to contine driving and guides you back to the TOTPADLATAT.

      After a minute of silence, the instructor says "Well, at least you pulled over correctly. I'm feeling lucky. Let's call it a day before my luck runs out.".

      The instructor guides you back to the TOTPADLATAT and hands you your driving license.

      You hit the spaceship head-on, and it explodes in a ball of fire.

      The alien laughs and says, "Sure thing, Earthling!".

      It takes you to the remains of its spaceship, which is still smoldering on the ground. 

      It graciously accepts your help and together you both fix some of the critical components that bring the spaceship back to a working condition.

      It then offers you a ride in the spaceship as thanks for helping fix it.

      As you drop the alien off at its destination, it thanks you and gives you a strange, glowing rock as a gift.

      Instructor informs you that you already successfully completed all the components involved in the test as you were dropping off the alien.

      Plus he thinks that you also did a good deed.

      So he is pleased.

      The instructor guides you back to the TOTPADLATAT and hands you your driving license.

      Once the spaceship is fixed, the alien climbs into the cockpit and motions for you to sit in the co-pilot's seat.

      You don't think it is a good idea to continue the test.

      You inform the instructor who was surprisingly waiting for you back on land.

      You request him to drop you home.

      He is kind enough to oblige and asks you to take care.

      You think to yourself that even though you did not pass the test, it was a hell of an experience.

      The instructor looks at you and says "Why don't we find out? Let's go back to the alien and discuss."

      You ignore the instructor's sarcasm when you notice that the alien is chasing after you on foot.

      You think to yourself, of course it can run fast.

      You want to speed up to escape the alien, but you don't wanna fail your driving test.

      So you carefully stay within the speed limit.
    choices:

      The instruct shouts, "What are you doing? You know the speed limit is 40 miles per hour, right? You are already at the speed limit. If you go any further, I will have to fail you.".

      After hearing this, you accept your fate and keep driving at the speed limit.

      Obviously, the alien catches up.

      Instead of blasting off your vehicle as you feared, it signals you to pull over instead.
